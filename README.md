# 3S-score
The genetic algorithm aided 3-stage ensemble learning method (3S score)

The code of 3S score can be found here!

The 3S score model is "3Smodel.RData". The usage of this model can be found at "ROC_survival_curve". And we also provided an easily-to-use web tool which is based on our 3S score (https://sujiezhulab.shinyapps.io/3S_score/). The code and file of our nomogram can be found at "nomogram" and the code of our web-tool can be found at "appGBM" file.The 47 basic learners can be found at "47models"

The permutation of ROC curves related code can be found at "permutationtest".

The genetic algorithm related code can be found at "genetic_algorithm".

The PCA analysis related code can be found at "PCA".

The pan-cancer analysis related code can be found at "pan-cancer".

The detailed version information of packages in R is shown in the "Session Info.txt" file.
